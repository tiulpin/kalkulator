EXPLANATIONS = """#### ðŸ¤” What are the formulas and how the calculator works?
1. You have to pay 2.65% to National Health Service and 8.3% for the Social insurance.
2. Then your salary is taxed by the payroll tax (progressive): depending on how big is your salary the different tax rate applies to you.

Also, it's possible to get a tax benefit (an exemption) on Cyprus if you are working there for the first time in your life.
It means that 20% (or 50%) if your income won't be taxed at all.

So the total tax is calculated the following way:
```
taxable_year = salary - social_tax - nhs_tax
payroll_tax(taxable_year)
```

Here are the bands for the payroll tax the last year:

| Taxable income band EUR	  | National income tax rates     |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------:|
| 0 to 19,500                 | 0%                            |
| 19,501 to 28,000            | 20%                           |
| 28,001 to 36,300            | 25%                           |
| 36,301 to 60,000            | 30%                           |
| 60,000 and more             | 35%                           |


#### ðŸ¤‘ Your employee pays you some benefits or charges for something else
It could be a parking space you must pay for yourself. It could be the lunch allowance, insurance coverage, or travel 
allowance you get additionally. Just look inside your payslips. 
Given that the situation is different for every company, this calculator does only one job: 
approximate your annual income.
