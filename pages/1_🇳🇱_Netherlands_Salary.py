The calculations are perfectly explained in 
[iamexpat.nl article](https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/taxation/dutch-tax-system).


#### ðŸ¤‘ Your employee pays you some benefits or charges for something else
It could be a parking space you must pay for yourself. It could be the lunch allowance, insurance coverage, or travel 
allowance you get additionally. Just look inside your payslips. 
Given that the situation is different for every company, this calculator does only one job: 
approximate your annual income.

#### ðŸ‘® You might be eligible for a tax refund if you didn't work the entire year
When you get your salary, you pay taxes based on your annual income (from the contract), but when you work only for 
part of the year, your actual payment might be lower than your expected yearly income. 
That is why you could get a refund from the tax services; you will have to fill in the tax declaration. 
More information about filling out the declaration can be found in 
[iamexpat.nl article](https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/taxation/annual-dutch-tax-form).

#### ðŸ¤· The stupid developer made a mistake
If you think that the calculator is wrong, please [drop me a message](https://t.me/tiulpin), and I will fix it as soon as possible.
